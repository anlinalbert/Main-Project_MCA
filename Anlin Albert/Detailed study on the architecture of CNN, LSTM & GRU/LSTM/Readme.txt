A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited for 
processing sequential data, such as time series or natural language. LSTMs are designed to overcome the limitations
of traditional RNNs, which have difficulty in preserving long-term dependencies in sequential data.

An LSTM network is composed of multiple LSTM cells, each of which contains several components:

1. Input Gate: This gate controls the amount of new information that is allowed to flow into the cell state.

2. Forget Gate: This gate controls the amount of information that is removed from the cell state.

3. Cell State: This is the internal memory of the LSTM cell, where information is stored over time.

4. Output Gate: This gate controls the amount of information that is allowed to flow out of the cell 
state and into the output.

5. Hidden State: This is the output of the LSTM cell at a given time step, which is used as input 
for the next time step.

The LSTM cell uses these gates and states to selectively preserve or discard information from the input sequence, 
allowing it to remember important information for a longer period of time.

LSTMs are often used in natural language processing tasks such as language translation, 
text generation and sentiment analysis.

It is also worth noting that there are variations of LSTM such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) which have similar 
functionality but a simpler structure and therefore less parameters, making it easier to train on larger datasets.
