A Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is similar to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
cells, but with a simpler structure. Like LSTMs, GRUs are designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs, 
which have difficulty in preserving long-term dependencies in sequential data.

A GRU cell has two gates:

1. Update Gate: This gate controls the amount of information that is allowed to flow into the hidden state, 
similar to the input gate in LSTM.

2. Reset Gate: This gate controls the amount of information that is discarded from the hidden state, similar 
to the forget gate in LSTM.

3. Hidden state: This is the output of the GRU cell at a given time step, which is used as input for the next time step.

4. The update gate and reset gate work together to decide what information should be passed on to the next time step, 
and what information should be discarded.

GRUs are often used in similar tasks as LSTMs such as natural language processing, speech recognition, 
and text generation.

GRUs have the advantage of having fewer parameters compared to LSTMs which can make them faster to train 
and easier to optimize. However, LSTMs have been proven to perform better in certain tasks such as 
language translation and language modeling.
